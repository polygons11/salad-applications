# TODO

- Make a linux & mac version with docker (there is .dockerenv so why not?)
- Make bandwith sharing worldwide (hopefully soon)
- Return the old version (i miss the times i mined with my i5-8500 1$/day with salad)

i saw all this requested by the community at [r/SaladChefs](https://www.reddit.com/r/saladchefs)

#### TODO list made by [polygons1](https://www.github.com/polygons1) and the idea from [u/sussyamongus](https://attachment.zip) on reddit
